- Fix for occasional stream TUI panic during builds with long file paths (https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex/issues/105)
- If auto-upgrade fails due to a permissions issue, suggest re-running command with `sudo` (https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex/issues/97 - thanks @kalil0321!)
- Include 'openrouter' in list of model providers when adding a custom model (https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex/issues/107)
- Make terminal prompts that shouldn't be optional (like the Base URL for a custom model) required across the board (https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex/issues/108)
- Data that is piped into `plandex load` is now automatically given a name in `context ls` via a call to the `namer` role model (previously it had no name, making multiple pipes hard to disambiguate).
- Still show the '(r)eject file' hotkey in the `plandex changes` TUI when the current file isn't scrollable.
