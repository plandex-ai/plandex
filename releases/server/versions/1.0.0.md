##   ☄️  🌅   A new era for AI driven development: gpt-4o is the real deal for coding agents

- gpt-4o, OpenAI's latest model, is the new default model for Plandex. 4o offers a step-wise improvement over gpt-4-turbo for coding tasks and agent-based workflows. Another level of capabilities is now achievable.
- If you have not used `plandex set-model` or `plandex set-model default` previously to set a custom model, you will now be use gpt-4o by default. If you *have* used one of those commands, use `plandex set-model` or `plandex set-model default` and select the new `gpt-4o-latest` model-pack to upgrade. 
 
##   🛰️  🏥   Major reliability improvements: 90% reduction in syntax errors in early testing

- Automatic syntax and logic validation with an auto-correction step for file updates.
- Significantly improves reliability and reduces syntax errors, mistaken duplication or removal of code, placeholders that reference other code and other similar issues. 
- With a set of ~30 internal evals spanning 5 common languages, syntax errors were reduced by over 90% on average with gpt-4o. 
- Logical errors are also drastically reduced (I'm still working on evals for those to get more precise numbers).
- Plandex is now much better at handling larger files and plans that make many updates to the same file. These could be problematic in previous versions.
- Plandex is much more resilient to incorrectly labelled file blocks where the model used the file label format incorrectly to explain something rather than for a file. i.e. "Run this script" and then a bash script block. Previously Plandex would mistakenly try to create a file called "Run this script". It now ignores these kinds of blocks based on a simple heuristic.
- If you tried Plandex previously but found it too error-prone, I'd recommend giving it another shot. With gpt-4o and auto-correction, it's a new ballgame. We'll of course have to see what the stats are like in the wild, but it certainly looks promising.

##   🧠  🚞   Major improvements to core planning engine: better memory and less laziness allow you to accomplish larger and more complex tasks without errors or stopping early

- Plandex is now much better at working through long plans without skipping tasks, repeating tasks it's already done, or otherwise losing track of what it's doing.
- Plandex is much less likely to leave TODO placeholders in comments instead of fully completing a task, or to otherwise leave a task incomplete.
- Plandex is much less likely to end a plan before all tasks are completed.

##   🏎️  📈   Major performance improvements: 2x faster planning and execution

- gpt-4o is twice as fast as gpt-4-turbo for planning, summarization, builds, and more.
- If you find it's streaming too fast and you aren't able to review the output, try using the `--stop / -s` flag with `plandex tell` or `plandex continue`. It will stop the plan after a single response so you can review it before proceeding. Use `plandex continue` to proceed with the plan once you're ready.
- Speaking of which, if you're in exploratory mode and want to use less tokens, you can also use the `--no-build / -n` flag with `plandex tell` and `plandex continue`. This prevents Plandex from building files until you run `plandex build` manually.

##   💰  🪙   2x cost reduction: gpt-4o is half the per-token price of gpt-4-turbo

- For the same quantity of output, with improved quality and 2x speed, you'll pay roughly half-price. Not too shabby.

##   👩‍💻  🎭   New `plandex-dev` and `pdxd` alias in development mode

- In order to avoid conflicts/overwrites with the `plandex` CLI and `pdx` alias, a new `plandex-dev` command anbd `pdxd` alias has been added in development mode. 

##  🐛  🛠️   Bug fixes

- Fixed a potential panic during account creation (https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex/issues/76)
- Fix for occasional "Stream buffer tokens too high" error (https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex/issues/34).
- Fix for potential panic when updating model settings. Might possibly be the cause of or somehow related to https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex/issues/121 but hard to be sure (maybe AWS was just being flakey).
- Attempted fix for rare git repo race condition @jesseswell_1 caught in the wild that gives error ending with: 
```
Exit status 128, output
      * Fatal: unable to write new_index file
```
I'm now treating those like deadlocks and retrying the git command a few times with a backoff since previous attempts at airtight locking seem to still let some error cases slip through no matter the approach. If you see this error again, please let me know on Discord or GitHub. Fun fact: Plandex implemented this fix (with assistance from ChatGPT which first conceived the general approach). I was just the reviewer. 😄

##   📚  🤔   Readme updates
