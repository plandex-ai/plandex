# Moving from v1 to v2

While built on the same foundations, Plandex v2 is designed to be run separately and independently from v1. It's not an in-place upgrade. So there's nothing in particular you need to do to upgrade; just [install](./install.md) v2 as if you were a brand new user.

## Future Versions

While it would have been nice to maintain compatibility, the large scope of changes and experimental nature of v1 made it more trouble than it was worth. 

That said, going forward, the intention is to release future versions as in-place upgrades so that all your projects and data will remain in one place.

## Feedback

If you're a v1 user and you really want to bring your existing plans into v2, please [speak up on Discord](https://discord.gg/plandex-ai) or [on GitHub](https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex/discussions). This is doable, but I want to be sure there's demand for it before putting in the work.

## What's New?

Check out the [2.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex/releases/tag/v2.0.0) for an overview of what's new in v2. There's a lot!
